Open the gates and seize the day
Don't be afraid and don't delay
Nothing can break us,
No one can make us.
Give our rights away,
Arise and seize the day.

Now is the time to seize the day
(Now is the time to seize the day)
Send out the call and join the fray
(Send out the call and join the fray)
Wrongs will be righted
If we're united
Let us seize the day

Sorry that is all I nkow :(
