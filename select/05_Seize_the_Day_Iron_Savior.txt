Sometimes there are those days
When good is getting better
The sun is shining brighter
The world is at ease
When everything is possible
And nothing holds you back
The weight is getting lighter
Your mind is at ease

And when the clouds
Are on the verge of moving in
Don't be afraid
'Cause the coast will clear again
Don't be late and ride this wave
Time is standing still

Don't be afraid of tomorrow
Right here and now we'll seize the day
Forget the worries and your sorrows
Hold on to the moment
And seize the day

Into the open range
You ride on wheels of fire
Nothing is forbidden
Reason's overruled
Take down the roof
And make sure you're wearing shades
You know cool is the rule
Reason is for fools

And when the darkness's
On the verge of moving in
Don't be afraid
'Cause the sun will rise again
Don't be late and ride this wave
Time is standing still

Don't be afraid of tomorrow
Right here and now we'll seize the day
Forget the worries and your sorrows
Hold on to the moment
And seize the day

And when the clouds
Are on the verge of moving in
Trust your belief
That the coast will clear again
Don't be late and ride this wave
Time is standing still

Don't be afraid of tomorrow
Right here and now we'll seize the day
Forget the worries and your sorrows
Hold on to the moment
And seize the day

Don't be afraid of tomorrow
Right here and now we'll seize the day
Forget the worries and your sorrows
Hold on to the moment
And seize the day

Come and seize the day
Seize the day
