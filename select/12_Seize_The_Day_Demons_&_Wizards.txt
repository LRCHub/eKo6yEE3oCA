On and on this is my way
I've made up my mind
But will I find what I search for
Soon I will reach the western shore

Far behind in the distance
Lie the fires of doom
There's a voice deep inside me
"The tower knows who you are"

The road goes on and on
Tomorrow I'll be gone
The road goes on and on
Tomorrow I'll be gone

I hear him say "We seize the day"

Too many roads we've travelled on
We seize the day
Now there's one thing left to lose
We seize the day
Until the end we'll carry on
We seize the day
Now there's one thing left to lose
We seize the day

All along this is my way
I've better move on
Pure in heart and fair-minded
For strenght and truth I keep on

Keep the one that is passed on
And leave the others behind
All alone and without me
I hear him say"We seize the day"

So stay with me we'll carry on
See the winding road goes on and on
